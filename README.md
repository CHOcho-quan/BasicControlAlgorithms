# BasicControlAlgorithms
My repo of basic control theory algorithms implementation.

- PID : A industrial faced control algorithm using P、I、D three parts of transfer function
  The implementation of PID is simple but with full function about clamping method to solve the I term saturation problem & Low Pass Filter on the D term.

- Kalman Filter 

  - Collecting information that cannot be directly detected
  - Cohering the information from mutiple sensor devices

  The implementation of KF is the ordinary Kalman Filter. Unscented Kalman Filter may be added later and the filter is used in some of my other projects.
